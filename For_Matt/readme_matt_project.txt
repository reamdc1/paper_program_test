Matt:

This document will tell you roughly how to re-create what we are looking for.
1) look at the file Fani_2005.pdf.  Figure 3 is what we are looking to re-create.
2) i have enclosed 6 operon files. They are hideous to look at, you need to get 2 pieces of information from them though.
    - the organism name.  it should be easy enough to identify.
    - the operon structure we are reporting. it is the line that starts "++"
3) the operon line will have groups of genes, and separate groups are delineated by ' ' (space).
The goal was to report gene blocks in a human natural way. as such, atpCDGAHFEB is the operon in the + strand.  -> -> --> --> would be the arrow convention.
conversely, <atpCDGAHFEB> would be the operon on the - strand.  <-- <-- <- <- would be the arrow convention.
As stated previously, spaces denote a new group, so you have to show that there is a break in the gene block structure.

The Fani paper figure also has the tree topology for the proteobacteria that we are looking at.  When you make your trees, the organisms should be in that order, since
that will make tree comparisons much easier.
